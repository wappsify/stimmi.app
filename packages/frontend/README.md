This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
bun dev
```

Usually, you'll want to run `docker compose up` instead, as that will run the API server, the frontend and the database at once.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project, take a look at the `.env.example` file to know which variables you need to set.
